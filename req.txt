Active Directory Environment:
The network contains two Active Directory forests named corp.fabnkam.com and rd.fabrikam.com. There are no trust relationships between the forests. Corp.fabrikam.com is a production forest that contains identities used for internal user and computer authentication. Rd.fabrikam.com is used by the research and development (R&D) department only. The R&D department is restricted to using on-premises resources only.

Network Infrastructure:
Each office contains at least one domain controller from the corp.fabrikam.com domain.
The main office contains all the domain controllers for the rd.fabrikam.com forest.
All the offices have a high-speed connection to the Internet.
An existing application named WebApp1 is hosted in the data center of the London office. WebApp1 is used by customers to place and track orders. WebApp1 has a web tier that uses Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) and a database tier that runs Microsoft SQL Server 2016. The web tier and the database tier are deployed to virtual machines that run on Hyper-V.
The IT department currently uses a separate Hyper-V environment to test updates to WebApp1.
Fabrikam purchases all Microsoft licenses through a Microsoft Enterprise Agreement that includes Software Assurance.

Problem Statement:
The use of Web App1 is unpredictable. At peak times, users often report delays. At other times, many resources for WebApp1 are underutilized.

Requirements: Planned Changes:
Fabrikam plans to move most of its production workloads to Azure during the next few years.
As one of its first projects, the company plans to establish a hybrid identity model, facilitating an upcoming Microsoft Office 365 deployment
All R&D operations will remain on-premises.
Fabrikam plans to migrate the production and test instances of WebApp1 to Azure.

Technical Requirements:
Fabrikam identifies the following technical requirements:

Web site content must be easily updated from a single point.

User input must be minimized when provisioning new app instances.

Whenever possible, existing on premises licenses must be used to reduce cost.

Users must always authenticate by using their corp.fabrikam.com UPN identity.

Any new deployments to Azure must be redundant in case an Azure region fails.

Whenever possible, solutions must be deployed to Azure by using platform as a service (PaaS).

An email distribution group named IT Support must be notified of any issues relating to the directory synchronization services.

Directory synchronization between Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and corp.fabhkam.com must not be affected by a link failure between Azure and the on premises network.

Database Requirements:
Fabrikam identifies the following database requirements:

Database metrics for the production instance of WebApp1 must be available for analysis so that database administrators can optimize the performance settings.

To avoid disrupting customer access, database downtime must be minimized when databases are migrated.

Database backups must be retained for a minimum of seven years to meet compliance requirement

Security Requirements:
Fabrikam identifies the following security requirements:

Company information including policies, templates, and data must be inaccessible to anyone outside the company

Users on the on-premises network must be able to authenticate to corp.fabrikam.com if an Internet link fails.

Administrators must be able authenticate to the Azure portal by using their corp.fabrikam.com credentials.

All administrative access to the Azure portal must be secured by using multi-factor authentication.

The testing of WebApp1 updates must not be visible to anyone outside the company.

Case Study 3: Contoso (Topic 3) *
                                *
*********************************

Existing Environment: Technical Environment
The on-premises network contains a single Active Directory domain named contoso.com. Contoso has a single Azure subscription.

Existing Environment: Business Partnerships
Contoso has a business partnership with Fabrikam, Inc. Fabrikam users access some Contoso applications over the internet by using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) guest accounts.

Requirements: Planned Changes
Contoso plans to deploy two applications named App1 and App2 to Azure.

Requirements: App1
App1 will be a Python web app hosted in Azure App Service that requires a Linux runtime. Users from Contoso and Fabrikam will access App1.
App1 will access several services that require third-party credentials and access strings. The credentials and access strings are stored in Azure Key Vault.
App1 will have six instances: three in the East US Azure region and three in the West Europe Azure region.
App1 has the following data requirements:

Each instance will write data to a data store in the same availability zone as the instance.

Data written by any App1 instance must be visible to all App1 instances.
App1 will only be accessible from the internet. App1 has the following connection requirements:

Connections to App1 must pass through a web application firewall (WAF).

Connections to App1 must be active-active load balanced between instances.

All connections to App1 from North America must be directed to the East US region. All other connections must be directed to the West Europe region.
Every hour, you will run a maintenance task by invoking a PowerShell script that copies files from all the App1 instances. The PowerShell script will run from a central location.

Requirements: App2
App2 will be a NET app hosted in App Service that requires a Windows runtime. App2 has the following file storage requirements:

Save files to an Azure Storage account.

Replicate files to an on-premises location.

Ensure that on-premises clients can read the files over the LAN by using the SMB protocol.
You need to monitor App2 to analyze how long it takes to perform different transactions within the application. The solution must not require changes to the application code.

Application Development Requirements
Application developers will constantly develop new versions of App1 and App2. The development process must meet the following requirements:

A staging instance of a new application version must be deployed to the application host before the new version is used in production.

After testing the new version, the staging version of the application will replace the production version.

The switch to the new application version from staging to production must occur without any downtime of the application.

Identity Requirements
Contoso identifies the following requirements for managing Fabrikam access to resources:
uk.co.certification.simulator.questionpool.PList@1a20ca90 (This appears to be an OCR artifact or placeholder text, not a requirement itself. The actual requirement seems to be missing or implied as: Every month, an account manager at Fabrikam must review which Fabrikam users have access permissions to App1. Accounts that no longer need permissions must be removed as guests. - This is inferred from Q26 explanation)

The solution must minimize development effort.

Security Requirement
All secrets used by Azure services must be stored in Azure Key Vault.
Services that require credentials must have the credentials tied to the service instance. The credentials must NOT be shared between services.
